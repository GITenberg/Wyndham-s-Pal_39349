description: Although he was born in and spent much of his life in England, Harold
  Bindloss spent some of his formative early adulthood in Western Canada. His memories
  of this time served as creative fodder when Bindloss turned to fiction writing later
  in life. Wyndham's Pal serves up classic Bindloss at his best, with plenty of action,
  adventure, and romance.
